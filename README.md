# Why do I need this?

If you need to build a simple one page website—little more than a website-as-business-card—using a CMS like WordPress is overkill. The ongoing maintenance is more taxing than the site is worth.

But that CMS does a lot of things for your site that you may not be aware of. A modern website is more than just HTML and CSS. How do you re-create some of those features from scratch?

You don't have to. This simple template has all the bells and whistles you need.
